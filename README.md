# **Emotion Recognition from Speech & Personal Portfolio Website**  
ðŸ“Œ **Internship Project - CODEALPHA**  

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**  
This project consists of two parts:  
1. **Emotion Recognition from Speech** â€“ Developing a deep learning model to analyze and classify emotions from spoken audio.  
2. **Personal Portfolio Website** â€“ Creating a **responsive and interactive** personal portfolio showcasing skills, projects, and resume.  

## **ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Emotion Recognition from Speech**  
This part involves building a **speech emotion recognition (SER) system** using **deep learning** and **speech processing techniques**. The model will classify spoken sentences into emotions like **happiness, anger, sadness, fear, and neutrality**.  

### **ðŸ“Œ Key Features**  
- **Audio Feature Extraction** using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).  
- **Deep Learning Model** â€“ Utilizing CNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers for emotion classification.  
- **Dataset** â€“ Using publicly available datasets like RAVDESS, CREMA-D, or TESS.  
- **Evaluation Metrics** â€“ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.  

### **ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used**  
- **Python (Google Colab)**  
- **Libraries:** Librosa, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib   

## **ðŸ“Œ Expected Outcome**  
- A functional **speech emotion recognition model** with high accuracy.  
- A fully responsive **portfolio website** showcasing personal skills and projects.
